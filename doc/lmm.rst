Variance Components Estimation
==============================

Pydigree can estimate variance components for phenotypes using a model in the form

.. math::
    y = \mathbf{X\beta} + \mathbf{Z}a 

where y is the outcome, X is a matrix of fixed effects parameters, and Z is an incidence matrix of random effects.
